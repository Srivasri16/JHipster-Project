**JHipster Project**

Entity relationship Project for Authors and Books -
April 2020  

Developed a Monolithic application using JHipster, showing the 
relationship between Authors and Books.  
 
Used Local Installation with NPM, Docker automated build and 
local host to run the project  

Worked with the entity sub-generator creating database tables 
automatically like JPA Entity, Spring Data JPA repository, Spring 
MVC REST Controller with CRUD operations, Angular router and 
HTML view; Also imported entities from JDL studio. 

Showcased different Entity relationship types
